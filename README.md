## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## My process

I started with the basic HTML and CSS appearance to match the wireframes/design patterns provided. I then added a javascript layer to add the display functionality.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

I had to research how to add event listeners to multiple elements as intially didn't realise that using querySelectorAll returned a list. I then looped through the elements to add the click functionality.

### Continued development

I will probably rebuild this in React as I realise that each question and answer element would work as components.
